	In creating NGMA, I arranged its various phonetic features into vowels,<br> consonants, vowel/consonant vowel/vowel and 
	consonant/consonant pairs,<br> pronounciations of the letter "R", as well as shorthand versions of common words.<br><br>
	<br>The following image is one of the original keys I had developed in<br> my sophomore year of high school for NGMA's handwritten variation.</p>

<br><i>Brothers Karamazov<br>character &#8470; - 646</i></h2>
	<div class="engTxt">"In that sense, "all things are lawful" for him. What's more, even if this period never 
	comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is the only one 
	in the whole world, and promoted to his new position, he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old 
	slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost 
	place ... "all things are lawful" and that's the end of it! That's all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a 
	moral sanction for doing it?"</div>
<br><h2 style="font-family:Prosto One"><i>Fountainhead<br>character &#8470; - 651</i></h2>
	<div class="engTxt">"When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. 
	To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere 
	in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation--anchored to nothing. That's the emptiness 
	I couldn't understand in people. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or motor. Power 
	without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions is scattered in every other living person. It's 
	everywhere and nowhere and you can't reason with him."</div>
<br><h2 style="font-family:Prosto One"><i>Odyssey<br>character &#8470; - 824</i></h2>
	<div class="engTxt">"Hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point, 
	straight into the monster's eye they rammed it hard - I drove my weight on it from above and bored it home 
	as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright's drill that men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl 
	and the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping - So we seized our stake with its fiery tip 
	and bored it round and round in the giant's eye till blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft 
	and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core and the broiling eyeball burst - its crackling roots blazed 
	and hissed - as a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze in an ice - cold bath and the metal screeches steam 
	and its temper hardens - that's the iron's strength - so the eye of the Cyclops sizzled round that stake!"</div></div>
